Slot machines are a popular attraction in casinos, and often become coated in dust and grime over time. Cleaning a Mills slot machine can be a daunting task, but it is not as difficult as it may seem. 

The first step is to gather the necessary supplies. You will need a vacuum cleaner, a wet rag, dish soap, a toothbrush, and some WD-40 or another lubricant. If you do not have WD-40, you can use white vinegar. 

Next, remove the currency tray and the playing cards from the machine. This can usually be done by pulling on them; the tray will usually come out with some resistance. Once these pieces are removed, locate the screws that hold the top of the machine in place and remove them. 

Once the screws have been removed, lift off the top of the machine and set it aside. Be careful not to damage any of the wiring or electronic components inside. Now you can see the internal workings of the machine. 

The first thing you should do is vacuum all of the dust and dirt from inside the machine. Next, use a wet rag to clean any sticky substances or residue off of the metal parts.

Replace the top of the machine and reattach the screws. Then replace the currency tray and playing cards. Finally, vacuum up any remaining debris from outside of the machine. Your Mills slot machine should now be clean and running like new!
