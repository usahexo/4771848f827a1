# How do I bet in the Blirix Workshop?

## The basics

Betting in the Blirix Workshop is simple - all you need to do is send a bet to the contract address with the amount you want to wager and the odds you're backing. If your bet wins, you'll receive double your original investment plus the return of your stake; if it loses, you'll lose your entire investment.

For example, if you want to back a horse at odds of 3/1, you would send 5 Ether (the amount you want to bet) to the contract address with the data "3" (indicating that you're backing the horse at 3/1 odds).

## Placing multiple bets

You can also place multiple bets by sending multiple transactions to the contract address. For example, if you wanted to back two horses at different odds, you could send two separate transactions (one for each bet) with the relevant data.

## Cancelling bets

If for some reason you decide that you no longer want to back a particular horse, you can cancel your bet by sending a transaction with the data "cancel" to the contract address. This will return your stake back to your account, although you will not receive any winnings if your bet is successful.
