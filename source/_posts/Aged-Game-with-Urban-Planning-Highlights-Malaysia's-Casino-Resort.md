#  Aged Game with Urban Planning Highlights Malaysia's Casino Resort

_Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_ - Genting Highlands Resort, a hill resort about an hour's drive from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, is unveiling a new attraction for visitors: an outdoor amusement park featuring vintage arcade games and a replica of an old-fashioned Malaysian town.

The new attraction is called _Street of Fun_ and it brings to life decades-old games like pinball and Pac-Man as well as traditional handicrafts and street snacks. There's even a simulated monsoon rainstorm that visitors can experience.

Genting Highlands Resort is billing the new attraction as a celebration of Malaysia's multicultural heritage. "Street of Fun" features traditional Chinese architecture and Malay woodcarving, along with Indian drumming and dance performances.

The $28 million amusement park is part of a broader effort by Genting Highlands Resort to revive interest in its gambling destination. Malaysia's casino sector has been hit hard by competition from neighboring Singapore, which has more restrictive gaming laws.

Genting Highlands Resort is hoping that its new amusement park will attract more visitors from Kuala Lumpur and beyond. The park will be open daily from 10am to 6pm, with tickets priced at 60 ringgit (about $14) for adults and 30 ringgit (about $7) for children between ages three and 12.

#  Casino-Resort Boom in Aged Game: Urban Centers Edition

When one contemplates casino resorts, what probably comes to mind is an extravagantly built facility tucked away in a picturesque and secluded location. While this model has proven successful in many cases, developers are now looking to tap into another market: urban communities.

A recent study by the Las Vegas Review-Journal found that the majority of the city's $10.5 billion in casino resort development is slated for the downtown area. In addition, Caesars Entertainment Corporation recently announced its intentions to build a $375 million hotel and casino complex near Boston's TD Garden sports arena.

Why are casino resorts targeting urban areas? One reason is that there is more demand from consumers for these types of facilities. Another reason is that urban locations tend to be more cost-effective for developers. They don't have to incur the high costs associated with building in remote locations, and they can draw from a larger labor pool.

There are also strategic advantages to locating casinos in urban areas. For one thing, they can help revitalize downtrodden neighborhoods and spur economic growth. They can also serve as tourist attractions, bringing visitors into the city who will spend money on hotels, restaurants, and other amenities.

As more and more casinos are built in urban areas, it will be interesting to see how this affects the gaming landscape overall. One thing is for sure: competition is heating up and the stakes are getting higher!

#  Casinos, Hotels Propel Aged Game Economy

Las Vegas is the pinnacle example of a city that has built its economy around gambling. The riches derived from casinos and hotels have allowed the city to maintain a high level of attractiveness for convention goers and tourists, in turn keeping the game industry afloat.

However, this seductive allure may be starting to fade. The city recently reported its first decline in gambling revenue in 12 years. While gaming still accounts for almost half of its general fund, it is no longer growing at the pace it once was. This could spell trouble for an industry that is already feeling the heat from other entertainment options such as Broadway shows, concerts and shopping.

Interestingly, Macau – often referred to as the Las Vegas of Asia – is also seeing a slowdown in gambling revenue growth. In fact, casino operators are reporting their first ever quarterly losses there. This could be due to a crackdown by the Chinese government on illicit money flows, or simply because there are other more attractive leisure options available to affluent Chinese citizens now.

What does this mean for the game industry overall? One possibility is that we may see more consolidation within the casino and hotel industries as they battle to stay competitive. For example, Wynn Resorts has recently made a bid to acquire rival casino operator MGM Resorts International.

We may also see increased investment in new casino and hotel developments in more established gaming markets such as Las Vegas and Macau, as well as emerging ones like Japan. These projects tend to be very capital-intensive and carry significant risk, but if executed correctly they can provide a significant boost to local economies.
