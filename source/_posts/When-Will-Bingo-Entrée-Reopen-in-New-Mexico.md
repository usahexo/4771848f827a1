#  What Will Happen to Bingo Entrée in New Mexico?

The New Mexico Racing Commission voted unanimously to approve the closure of Bingo Entrée, a racino located in Santa Fe. The closure is set to take place on July 1, 2019.

Bingo Entrée has been plagued with financial issues for some time now. In October 2018, the casino announced that it would be closing its doors due to increasing costs and dwindling profits. However, the commission granted the casino a six-month reprieve in an effort to give it time to find a new owner or investor.

Despite this effort, no viable solution was found and the closure is now set to take place next month. This means that around 300 employees will lose their jobs.

The news of the closure has come as a shock to many in Santa Fe. Bingo Entrée has been a major employer in the city for many years and is one of just two casinos in the area. It is unclear what will happen to the local economy as a result of its closure.

Some residents are concerned that crime rates will increase as a result of the closure. Others are simply worried about what will happen to them now that their main source of income has dried up.

It is unclear what will happen to Bingo Entrée's property once it closes its doors. Some officials are hopeful that another casino or gaming establishment will move in, but nothing has been confirmed yet.
