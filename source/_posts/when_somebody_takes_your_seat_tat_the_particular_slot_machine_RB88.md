# When Somebody Takes Your Seat at a Slot Machine on RB88

Playing slot machines at an online casino like RB88 can be an enjoyable experience. However, what happens when you get up to take a break or use the restroom and somebody else takes your seat? This can be frustrating, but there are a few things you can do to handle the situation.

## Determine How Long They Have Been There

Before you approach the person who has taken your seat, it's essential to determine how long they have been sitting there. If it's only been a few minutes, it's possible that they didn't realize that the seat was taken. In this case, politely inform them that the seat is taken and ask them to move.

## Politely Ask Them to Move

Approach the person who has taken your seat and politely inform them that you were sitting there. Try to be calm and friendly in your approach. You don't want to start a confrontation. Ask them if they can move to a different seat or wait for you to return.

## Ask the Casino Staff for Assistance

If the person who has taken your seat is not willing to move, you can ask the casino staff for assistance. Explain the situation to them and ask them to intervene. They may be able to find another slot machine for you to play or ask the person to move.

## Avoid Confrontation

It's important to avoid confrontation when dealing with this situation. Getting angry or aggressive can escalate the situation and ruin your casino experience. Remember that everyone is there to have a good time and enjoy themselves.

## Conclusion

If somebody takes your seat at a slot machine on RB88, it can be frustrating, but there are ways to handle the situation. Determine how long they have been sitting there, politely ask them to move, or ask the casino staff for assistance. Avoid confrontation and remember to keep a level head.
