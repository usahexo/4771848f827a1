#  What is the Under the Sea Game?

The Under the Sea Game is an online game where you play as a fish and swim around the ocean. You can find food to eat, avoid obstacles, and interact with other sea creatures. The game is free to play and has no ads.

# How to Play

To play the game, you use your arrow keys to swim around. You can press "S" to speed up and "D" to dive down. There are three different types of food in the game: fish, seaweed, and shells. When you eat fish, your health will increase; when you eat seaweed, your energy will increase; and when you eat shells, your coins will increase. There are also three types of obstacles in the game: rocks, coral, and jellyfish. If you touch rocks, coral, or jellyfish, your health will decrease.

In addition to eating food and avoiding obstacles, you can also interact with other sea creatures. Each creature has its own unique behavior. For example, some creatures will follow you around while others will swim away when you get close.

The goal of the game is to collect as many coins as possible before time runs out. When time runs out, the game ends and you receive a score based on how many coins you collected.
