#  What is Betway blackjack? 

In Betway blackjack, you play against the dealer. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand, without going over 21. You can either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what you've got).

You also have the option of splitting your hand if you're dealt two cards of the same value (e.g. two kings), and doubling down if you want to increase your bet after seeing your first two cards.

The game progresses as follows: 

- Both you and the dealer receive two cards at the beginning of the game. 
- The player must decide whether to hit or stand. 
- If the player hits and goes over 21, they lose automatically. 
- If the player stands, the dealer then decides whether to hit or stand, based on their own hand. 
- The winner is determined by whichever hand has a higher total - not exceeding 21. 
- In some variants of blackjack, players can also "surrender" (give up) their hand if they think they're not going to win.

A blackjack free game is a new game in the casino industry that has taken the world by storm. This exciting and fast paced game can be played online or at a bricks and mortar casino. It is a card game that usually involves between two and six players. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. 

The game was created in 1922 in New Mexico and has been a favourite ever since. It is thought to have originated from a Spanish game called Twenty One. There are many variations of blackjack free but the most popular version is played with six decks of cards.
