#  You Can Bet on How Much the Ring Cost!

In Ring, there is a scene where Viggo Mortensen's character is looking for his children in a park. He comes across two young boys fighting over a ring and offers to buy it from them.

The price of the ring is never revealed, but many fans have been curious about how much it cost.

Now, there is a way for you to bet on how much the ring cost!

This week, UK-based bookmaker William Hill announced that they are offering odds on the ring's price. You can bet on whether the ring cost $10 or less, $11 to $100, or more than $100.

William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly said: "We are always looking to offer new markets and thought this would be a fun one ahead of the release of Ring."

So far, most people are betting that the ring cost more than $100. However, if you think that it cost less than $10, your odds are at 7/2!

#  Bettors Take Vegas by Storm with Rings Bets

In a strange turn of events, Vegas has become a hotbed for bettors looking to place a bet on who will win the 2020 Super Bowl. Oddsmakers are finding it difficult to keep up with the demand for bets on the two teams as people are betting on everything from the margin of victory to which team will score first.

“It’s been CRAZY here!” said an exasperated employee at one of the sportsbooks in Las Vegas. “People have been coming in and betting on anything and everything! We’ve even had people betting on who will score the first touchdown!”

While this may seem like an oddity, it is actually quite common for there to be large amounts of money wagered on the Super Bowl well in advance of the game. What is surprising about this year’s event is that so much action is being taken on the two teams that are still in the playoffs.

Some experts are attributing this surge in betting activity to a recent change in NFL rules that allows bands to be placed on players during games. This has given bettors a little more information to work with when making their predictions, and has led to increased interest in placing bets on which teams will win the Super Bowl.

Whatever the reason, it looks like Vegas is going to be busy for the next few weeks as football fans from all over place their bets on who will be crowned champion in 2020.

And last but not least, we have the NHL where Sidney Crosby leads the pack with two Stanley Cup Championships. Other notable winners include Patrick Kane (one cup), Anze Kopitar (one cup) and Alex Ovechkin (one cup).
